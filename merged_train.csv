My rates are close to 20%, even though my credit score is 770-780 (according to CreditSecure) and I need to do something about that. This loan will zero out my last card (~$3,000).<br/><br/>The remainder (if any) will go toward emergency repairs recently performed on the family house (which I do not currently live in, but do own 1/4 of). I am not sure what the remaining amount will be (if this loan doesn't reach 100%), but any amount would be helpful as the repairs were a significant and unexpected expense for me.<br/><br/>My income is derived from two small businesses my wife and I founded 4 and 5 1/2 years ago, to provide web design &amp; software development services. Both produce a modest monthly income (vs. get-rich-quick business models).<br/><br/>I applied for a 3 year loan initially, but the rate on the 5 year loan was very similar, so I selected that option instead.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading, if you have any further questions, just ask!<br/>",credit_card,Help pay off the last credit card,968xx,HI,14.81,0,0,,,9,0,2645,13.8,18,f,741.16,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,265th week,0,,,,1

I'm new to lending club, and given it's attractive interest rates I've decided to fund much of my medical expenses by borrowing through this program. My borrowing history is relatively light, and my credit is excellent at 760. Essentially, this financing will enable me to restructure my personal balance sheet, as most of my personal financing has historically been generated via cash assets. I have a very stable job situation, employed the past 4 years with Citigroup in its capital markets department. I graduated from Georgetown University in '06, and have recently been promoted to an Associate role with the firm in a rotationial program that will guarantee my job security for at least the next two years. My gross monthly salary totals close to 10k, my monthly expenses total close to 3k (rent: 1200, misc: 2k-mostly medical bills).<br/>",medical,Medical Loan,073xx,NJ,0.5,0,4,,,4,0,425,14.7,9,f,2539.21,29.8686786077,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,265th week,0,,,,1

I hope to be employed elsewhere when I retire from my current position but the salary will likely not be as much, at least that is the way I have to approach it.<br/>",debt_consolidation,cat;s meow,130xx,NY,18.9,0,2,,,22,0,19225,56.9,62,f,3980.19,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,91th week,0,,,,1

So if I consolidate all three into one and get a loan with just one interest rate, it would be great to just have 1 bill with a 10% interest rate instead of 3 cards that total 30%..<br/>  > Let me make a correction...I put 10% for the credit cards. What I meant to say was I would rather pay a fixed interest rate of 10% on just one loan rather than pay a variable interest on 3 credit cards. Which each credit card is at least 18% interest.  And what makes me a good candidate for repaying this loan off is that I am in the medical field which is in high demand so I do not see myself losing my job, I am in a very well stable field. As we all know there is a high demand in the medical field right, which is where I am right now. I pay my credit cards on time. I would just like to have the one monthly payment, instead of spreading them into 3 payments. Hoping to get the help that I need, as I will not disappoint anyone who is willing to help.<br/>  > I would also like to add that I had the option of doing a traditional bank loan, but when I found out about this peer to peer lending, I thought it was great that there are other individuals who are willing to invest their hard earned money to help others.

By paying off my debt and having just one simple payment to make, my life would be less stressful.

My church just finished a series of teachings called Crash Course in which we discussed the importance of having more margin in our lives, including time, morality and money. This can be found at TCABC.com under the teachings page if interested. The teaching on money margin really hit home, as my wife and I have made more money we have spent more money, like most Americans. We have gotten involved with Financial Peace University and started using Mint.com to help us achieve our goal of getting out of debt in 3 to 4 years. We have both been blessed to work for almost 10 years with companies that have shown steady growth even over the last 2 years instead of suffering from the economic downturn. I manage the recruiting for a division of one of the premier convenience store chains that has more new stores in development than it has in 20 years. We are doing very well. My wife is one the most popular pet groomers in the city, she has steady appointments booked for 2 to 3 months and has only seen growth each year despite the economy.

Current interest rates range for 12.90% to 26.99%. I will also be paying off the balance of my car of $14,900.00 with a payment of $683.00. Total of all debt to be paid off is $33,900.00 at payments at $1,188.00.<br/>Payment on the new loan should be $880.00 which shows a monthly debt savings of $308.00 per month, I should be able to apply this savings towards the new loan to shorten the term from 5 years to somewhere around 3.5 to 4 years.<br/>  <br/>What makes me a good borrower? I make a decent income of about $115,000.00 per year selling new homes for a large builder in a market that&rsquo;s been down but is now on its way back. While the housing market has been soft I have not had a decree in my income and my credit has not suffered. The large part of the debt is from my ex-wife which I took to help her knowing that she would not be able to pay which could affect my credit. I have never been late making payments on any of my debts and intend to keep it that way.<br/><br/>With this new loan my budget is simple, my mortgage payment is $1,780.00 and the new loan of $880.00 totals $2,660.00. My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments. The main goal for this loan is to get out from under the credit card lenders and their high rates as well as getting the debts from my ex wife paid off.<br/>  <br/>Regarding my job stability, last year was one of my highest income years since I have been in the new home building market, 9 years total and each year is better for me. I just had my yearly review from corporate and I have been asked to open a new subdivision in one of the area&rsquo;s best markets so my income is projected to rise again.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>  > The following is the break down of my current debt;<br/>Chase, $1,664 - 26.99% - $56 min<br/>Chase, $5,798 - 25.24% - $180 min<br/>Sears, $720 - 25.24% - $15 min<br/>USAA AMEX, $4,955 - 15.9% - $117 min<br/>Capital One, $1,520 - 14.66% - $35 min<br/>Capital One, $80 - 13.40% - $15 min<br/>Household Bank, $4,300 - 12.9% - $90 min<br/>Addison FCU (car), $14,900 - 6.9% - $682.97 monthly<br/><br/>My current mortgage balance is $315,000 and valued about $345,000.<br/><br/>I hope that this additional information is helpful in reaching your decision.<br/><br/>Thank you again.<br/>  > Some additional information for investors;<br/>After using an online debt reduction calculator and inputting the details of the proposed loan I have calculated that I should be able to repay this note as early as 39 months keeping my current payment structure at $1,200.

I will be using the money to consolidate some unexpected debts I have incurred over the past few years. I am curbing my spending to ensure future financial success.<br/>null  > I currently have around $6,000 left on an auto loan that was originally for $27,000. I pay that monthly at $512 per month. My plan is to take my Lending Club loan and pay off the vehicle and replace that monthly payment (which I'm used to and have been paying without incident for 49 months already) with the Lending Club monthly payment of $488. That will save me $25 a month on my regular budget. Then I plan to take the remaining $13,000 and pay down my large Visa balance which is currently at 19.99%. The Lending Club loan repayment will not be difficult to work into my budget because I will be replacing my auto loan with it.<br/>null  > I'm disappointed that my loan has not been fully funded yet. I feel like I have proven with my excellent credit score that I don't mess around with things like money. I don't feel it is acceptable to miss a payment on an obligation; I don't feel it is acceptable to not take care of my finances. Having said that, things happen, and over the past few years, I was not able to meet some unexpected personal needs with cash. These needs are resolved and I would like some money to get my use of credit back on track. For starters, I would prefer to pay personal investors 15% interest than a credit card company 20% interest! Out of college, I worked for a fortune 500 company for 8 years and then relocated and have been working for a different fortune 500 company since the spring of 2005. I have been promoted twice since working for my current company; once in 2006 and again just a few months ago. The industry I'm working in and the job I have is not going anywhere in the foreseeable future. I feel very secure in my profession and my current role. There is absolutely no doubt that the loan I'm applying for through Lending Club has been thoroughly researched, fits into my budget, and will be repaid within the boundaries of the lending agreement.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation Loan,660xx,KS,19.01,0,1,,,10,0,89584,82,18,f,8391.74,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,226th week,0,,,,0

Seems this has recently been my line.  Bought a home last year about this time and sunk all my savings into it to assure a very reasonable note.  Great idea, but unfortunately just a couple of days after moving in, things began to break!  Having had no time to accumulate any more savings, I was stuck utilizing a VERY high interest credit card, on which there was previously a balance of 0, to do things like replace a leaky roof, a faulty, exploding water heater, freshly soaked walls and carpet, etc....  Seems my home inspector might have caught those things but not so.  I do not hasten to appear as a damsel in distress; however, with an APR of 28%, I will be forever getting this card paid down!  <br/><br/>I would make an excellent candidate for this loan as my credit history is good, but in addition, the note on this loan is less than I am paying each month on this card with no end in sight.  In addition, my car will be paid off in 12 months so I plan to double up on loan installments after that and pay this loan off early.  It seems the only way I can get back ahead.

None of the companies are willing to negotiate a better rate so I am wanting to pay them all off and not do business with those companies any longer. I don't mind paying interest that is agreed upon but when they just raise rates from one month to the next, after being an on time paying customer for years, I don't feel that is a good business practice. A small portion of the funds will also be used to replace the stairs leading from the back of my home down to the back yard which is about an 8 foot drop. The home is 9 years old and the stairs must be replaced.   The estimated payment for this loan is actually slightly less than what I pay for all my credit cards combined on a monthly basis so it will not impact my monthly budget at all. It will actually free up about $50.00 a month.  As far as employment, I have been with one company for almost 8 years now as an audio engineer and computer systems tech. It's a small company and very stable since we are diverse in the type of work we do. When the market drops in one area, our work load increases in other. My second job as an audio engineer/lighting director for a Production company is also very stable. We provide concert gear for several national acts as well as a local group that has had steady work for the passed 5 years now and are booked a minimum of 6 nights a week 12 months in advance. I was contract until the beginning of this year when I was made an employee. That company is only getting busier by the day.  As my credit shows. I have not had any negative marks for at least 5 years now. I have made a huge effort to organize myself financially and have achieved it. The credit cards I have were all opened to help raise my credit score and everything was going fine until the market freaked out as we all know and the banks started raising everyone's rates.",credit_card,Credit Card payoff and deck addition.,782xx,TX,23.48,0,1,,,12,0,11369,91.7,16,f,5858.2,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,161th week,0,,,,1

Using the money to repair house so I can get a higher rental income/tennant. Remaining money going to conslidate outstanding debt (make it easier to pay 1 payment). 564203 added on 10/29/09 > Bit more information incase people are wondering: 1. Haven't missed a payment ever on anything 2. Revoling credit card is actually what I used to purchase house. Loan breakdown is as followed... 2,000 going toward repair remaining 10,000 used to pay down cash advance I took on credit card at 22% (other 10,000 was done at 8%) to buy house (Yes that is right for some it is a 20,000 home and yes it is rentable/livable the repairs are becuase I had a tennant in there and didn't pay rent and left the place dirty with problems and security deposit didn't cover it all). The rest of reovling creidt I pay every month (and hence no missed payments). House plan to rent for 500-600/mo range when completed repairs (repairs take 2-3 weeks max before back on market) and plan on using rent check to pay for loan. (Of course it is not needed as I make enough income without it). 3. 135/mo car payment 4. 500-600/mo rent target when repairs complete 5. 132/mo studnet loan 6. 275/mo credit card balance (the 8% one)  7. Income stated is all me, I have other rental properties but no way to verify this (and the income) it brings (is there?).  Why I haven't taken a HELCO on the houses I own for repairs? I have the houses in controllership of an LLC (that my wife and I own). For tax stargety I purposely want the LLC to have an external source (ME) providing capital for repairs rather than the LLC tapping into its own equity. It fits my long term goals of minimzing my tax payments. 564203 added on 10/30/09 > Update: I came into some money and don't need as high of a loan. I asked lending club to reduce from 12,000 to 3,500. I got fudning at a lower rate except for 3,500.

I had two credit cards with high credit line amounts cut down to just above the current amount owed (such as $21,000 to 10,900 and it drops every time I pay another 500 off). This ratio of total credit line to amount owed was always an emergency buffer in case of unforeseen expenses. This also affected my credit rating (was 730 a year ago) by lowering the owed to available ratio). I have a few expenses such as car repairs and a small garage roof leak which I'm putting off due to not enough credit card balance. I also have a few doctor bills (after the insurance paid their portion) for when my wife had a hospital visit due to a heart issue. I would use the money to pay these several small amounts and also pay off a few small amounts on store/gas/Dell credit accounts. The remainder would be kept in the bank as reserve so I wouldn't need to use a credit card and I can concentrate on paying them down to improve my credit rating.

I am a recent college graduate (class of '08) in Massachusetts who is employed by a private school's technology department.  My current gross annual income is 35,000 and I am receiving a promotion which will come into effect in early July.  While the new salary has not yet been negotiated, it will be a substantial increase (in excess of 10%).  I own a fully paid off car and rent a very inexpensive apartment (I have roommates, and pay a total of $400 a month after all utilities).    If you have already looked at my credit report, you will see that there are some small revolving balances as well as large installment ones.  The large installment balances are loans related to my education.  They are co-signed by my father, and he is the one who has been making the scheduled payments to them.  His financial situation is very secure and I see no reason he will not repay those ahead of schedule.    My request today, however, involves the revolving debt.  You will notice three accounts of interest, a Citi card account, a Capital One card account, and a Dell Financial Services account.  The three accounts charge 19%, 0%, and 0% respectively.  The Capital one account, while charging 0% currently, will soon increase its rate.  I expect to have the Dell account paid off well before the scheduled rate increase (in January).    As such, I've come to Lending Club seeking $6,000 to fully pay off my Citi and Capital one accounts.  Both credit cards were opened in my time between graduation and employment, an unfortunate but necessary way to raise funds.  My plan is to (pending loan approval) pay off the cards and then cease using them except for emergencies. My new income should be quite sufficient to live on and pay the Lending Club loan well before three years.    When selecting Lending Club two things attracted me.  One, of course, is the fantastic rates.  The other, however, is that I find the idea of small scale lenders (such as yourselves) making interest on my loans much preferable to the big banks to whom I am currently indebted.    Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to providing any additional information or clarification.

Current mortage loan to value on the home is 75%.  Property values have actually increased in this area despite national market trends over the last two years, due to the doubling in size of Fort Lee, VA as a result of the government's Base Realignment And Closure program.

I was left holding the financial bag.  My daughter has now struggled with depression and PTSD among other things that eventually led to her abusing drugs to cope with the pain.  I have exhausted the resources for treatment available to us and had to pay for all or part of of treatment she has received over the last couple of years which was an unforseen financial expense, divorce proceedings, and am trying to pay 6200.00 owed to the IRS for $ he removed from a 401K (without my knowledge prior to his incarceration).  I still have debt outstanding to four different medical groups in the amts of 345.00, 650.00, 175.00, and 565.00.  I have been able to eliminate extra expenses related to my daughter that have cost hundreds of dollars, and will continue to find additional ways to cut costs.  The tuition is for the other two children in Catholic school.  I realize this may seem unnecessary, but I have worked very hard to provide a stable, safe, and secure environment for two children who have experienced the unexpected loss of their father and the devastation their older sister's drug addiction has caused.  This is one security I cannot change.  Tuition payments obviously aren't paid in June and July.  Lastly, This year between Jan and May I have an additional 1368.00/mo with the GI Bill as a full-time student.  I will collect that same amount in the fall of 2010 between Sep-Dec. as well.  I haven't had an emergency fund and have been robbing Peter to pay Paul the last few months.  The purpose of the loan is to catch up on monthly expense bills (behind one month on all bills), pay off medical, pay down IRS and decrease Visa (17.4%) in an attempt to increase credit score.  I desperately need to start establishing an emergency fund.  I have anticipated vehicle maintenance costs upcoming as well.  Please let me know if you have additional questions.

This has been a very expensive process, dealing with Patent Attorneys that charge $250 , or more, per hour. This created debt and there will be other costs getting this product to licensing, with a fishing product manufactuer. I expect a licensing contract in less than 1 year, and am in the process of contacting companies, currently. Much of this debt was paid as I went, but also a lot was put on credit cards, not expecting the process to drag out nearly as long as it did!

Unfortunately the market drop over 30% in the area we lived in and so we did not initially sell and had someone renting.  Recently we listed the house for sale and we are currently in contract.  Therefore the difference in what we owe on our mortgage and what we are getting for the house is the amount listed for this loan.<br/>- The amount we were paying for the mortgage with utilities and condo fees was close to $1400 per month and since this loan will only be $500, we will be able to pay this down fairly quickly.<br/>- My husband also works for Direct Energy as a Pricing Analyst and brings home $55,000 per year.<br/>",other,Columbus,152xx,PA,19.23,0,1,,,11,0,18708,66.8,31,f,2768.93,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,157th week,0,,,,1

Hereâs some more information to help you in your investment decision.  <br/><br/>Professionally, I'm a physician and have been in practice since October, 2007.  I work in a government run hospital in the Emergency Room where I have been for over 2 years.  I have a great job, and due to a recent promotion, Iâll be getting a raise soon.  <br/><br/>Personally, I am good with my money.  I live within my means and as a rule try to only borrow money for school, purchasing a new home, babies, and cars if needed.  Up until I started having children, I paid cash for my cars, but upgraded for the safety of my two young children and my wife.  We bought a home a year ago, at a good price and interest, and are current on all debt.  We owe less than market value on our home, and also we have homeowners and mortgage insurance.  The mortgage insurance is the good kind, not part of my loan, but an extra insurance that I got for security.  It would make my mortgage payment for up to a year if I were to lose my job or were unable to work.  <br/><br/>Normally, we use one credit card, which we pay off every month.  The debt we have now comes from back in residency to buy my car, which I am still driving, when we had our first child.  Other debt we incurred when we were saving to buy our current home, we used our credit cards for some purchases to increase our cash savings to buy down our loan interest rate.  And lastly, we also bought a minivan after having a second child.  (Used, low mileage, and a great price due to a few small dents).  I also have student loans and the mortgage mentioned above.  <br/><br/>Plan: We are working to be debt free.  I want to consolidate and pay off the debts mentioned above first, then pay off student loans and mortgage.  Although, I can do this with my current job alone, I am also starting a part-time second job at a private hospitalâs ER on April 16th to earn extra money to get out of debt sooner.  We do have cash in savings in reserve for emergencies.  We also have an IRA and a government retirement account.<br/><br/>I hope this extra information helps you in your decision.  I am open to answer questions if you have them.  Thanks for your interest and investment.<br/>  > I tried to answer a question from an investor and accidentally deleted it, so here's some more information based on the questions.<br/><br/>I am the sole wage earner. <br/>No Second Mortgage.  No HELOC.<br/>I'd be happy to have automatic deductions from my checking account.  <br/><br/>Although my Income from my first job is sufficient to pay all my obligations, including this loan, I am starting a second job mid April 2010.<br/><br/>My backup plan:  If I were to lose my income from my primary job, which would be unlikely as I am tenured, have already had my yearly review, and due for a bonus and $15,000/year raise due to a recent promotion (I didnât include this in my salary reported, since it isnât showing on my paycheck yet).  If the worst were to happen and I lost my primary job, I would accept full-time status on the second job, which would pay more than my primary job without the benefits.  I didnât include any income from this second job in my proposal, as I havenât started it yet.  Having a second job increases my discretionary income and gives me increased control of my income, savings and a backup plan.  I also have a savings account, a cash reserve and short and long-term disability insurance.  Lastly, my student loans are deferrable, so as part of my back up plan above, if I needed to, Iâd put them into deferment and pay off my short-term debts first.<br/><br/>I hope this clarifies.  Thanks for your interest.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Doctor Loan,890xx,NV,6.42,0,0,,,14,0,15325,23.2,19,f,4452.82,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,157th week,0,,,,1

I plan to use the funds to help pay off my debt.  The balances vary from $200+ to $4000+ all with rates as high as 29.99%. I've been consistent with my payments, but it would easier to focus on one payment regarding paying off credit/loan debt.  I've been working in my job for 10 years now and enjoy it a lot and it allows me to live comfortably.  But, now I would like to focus on making clearing my debt as a goal and continue to push farther in life without being slowed/weighed down.  Thank you for your help.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Needing 2 get back on track,913xx,CA,14.03,1,0,15,,7,0,4896,56.9,13,f,2207.14,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,157th week,0,,,,1

Because of this I want to gain control of my finances and eliminate the credit card debt I have accrued in a timely  manner. From my credit report, you will see that I have a track record of paying my credit on time with no late payments whatsoever. To date, I have paid off a mortgage, a car loan and a personal signature loan, as well as other miscellaneous credit lines. I returned to college to get a Master's degree in a highly-specialized field, and during this period, I was financially dependent to some extent on credit cards and student loans (I also won scholarships). Using as my credit as I have had over the last several years has lowered my credit score only because of the impact it has had on my income-to-debt-ratio, but it is not at all due to unreliable behavior. My wife is financially independent with less than $500 of debt and my parents are covering my student loan payments until I get my credit card debt resolved. Your only fear should be that I may be able to pay off this loan before you get to collect all of the interest you may want to receive on it. My job is very stable and it is funded by two of the largest grants (RO1's) endowed to professors at Harvard Medical for the next ten years (Children's Hospital Boston research facilities are all affiliated with Harvard Medical School). I will probably be completing a doctorate here as well with a stipend comparable to my current salary. I would surely appreciate your confidence in me as a borrower and I look forward to making definite progress on paying down my credit card debt. Thank you very much.<br/>  > I understand I may not seem like a great yielding investment in comparison to some with worse credit scores, but in my instance you are guaranteed at least your money back. My monthly expenses can be estimated at about $1100 per month. However, I earn more than twice as much as that  per month. I am as reliable as they get because of the expectation I have for my life in the next ten years. This includes owning a home with my wife and raising a family. To be functional in this day and age, one needs great credit. To remain functional, I am trying to become debt free as soon as I possibly can. Help me get this loan, and not only can you feel good about the investment intrinsically, but there is a rather secure extrinsic reward waiting at the other end of this as well. Thank you.<br/>One sentence in the previous description has an obvious typo and was constructed incorrectly. It was meant to read:  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Using my credit as much as I have over the last several years as a full-time student without much income has lowered my credit score only because of the impact it's had on my income-to-debt-ratio, but it is not at all due to unreliable behavior.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""<br/>",credit_card,Just got married and just finished grad school; want to maintain control of debt,024xx,MA,20.04,0,0,,,10,0,15460,60.6,31,f,2231.86,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,161th week,0,,,,1

The income listed in not household but individual. This credit card has been paid off slowly from 22k to 7780 in a year and a half. The problem is everytime I make a huge payment, the credit card company lowers the credit limit to whatever I paid. For instance I made a 10k payment. Then they lowered the limit 10k. This affects my credit score and debt to ratio. I have never been late on a payment.  The credit card company claims that they have been affected by the economy and those whom filed chapter 13/7. So they are lowering credit limits to off set their loss. It's upsetting. I worked hard to have my credit score be in the excellent range, I never asked for a credit increase. They increased it, and when I used it with the intention to pay off in 2 years. They are now lowering it as I pay off, which affects me. I will cancel this card if my loan is funded. I have had that account for almost 13 years and this is the thanks I get from them. All the interest I have paid to them throughout the years has paid my debt probably 3 times over<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt free in 3!,600xx,IL,20.77,0,3,,,8,0,25484,75.4,22,f,900.93,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,61th week,0,,,,1

Ive been fortunate enough to have stayed employed throughout this down economy due to the demand of my industrys ability to make manufacturing systems efficient and more cost effective for companies throughout the country. If funded for this loan, I intend to pay off 7 accts and discontinue use of 4 of those accounts. The current loan payment is scheduled for $304 .66/mo but I can afford to pay $500-$600/mo and pay off the loan in 24 mos, sooner than the 60-month term offered. I pay my bills on time, I always pay over the min monthly payment requirement, and can afford my current debt and monthly expenses without this loan but Im hopeful for the help to pay this debt off sooner rather than later with the help of the lower APR than my current avg APR so I can better invest in my home improvement projects and rebuild the equity in my home so that I may refinance down the road, pay down my HELOC at a faster rate and better provide for my retirement.

For the first time in my life, I was unemployed in 2001 (last recession) for 8 months and used credit cards to pay expenses.  I chose not to file bankruptcy as I felt responsible to pay my debts. A few collection accounts (paid) from 2001 adversely affected my credit score for the past 7 years which meant the credit card APR's were high and paying down the debt was difficult.  Despite making more than the minimum payments;  making steady payments; and having a stable job (professional) and residency, my credit card/loan accounts are with the now notable BIG three banks.  In January of 2008, one of the banks raised my APR without providing a reason in writing!  I received a letter, but it only stated my APR would increase.  First I was told it was because of an adverse credit report and when I checked into this, it was not accurate.  Over the course of a year, when I requested to have the rate returned to the previous APR or reduced, the request was refused.  BUT, they were more than willing to offer me a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""great deal"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" where they would give me another credit card at a low interest rate!!  I refused and when I did the research, I discovered that this was a new tactic being used where the higher interest credit card account would have been closed and opening another account would have adversely affected my credit score (thus further indebting me to that bank)!!!!  This offer occurred when my credit score improved as the collections accounts from 2001 were no longer on my credit report......It is important to note that one of my bank card holders raised my credit limit at a time when banks were lowering credit limits and the bank that raised my APR, never lowered my credit limit......I'm not a high risk, I'm a cash cow and enslaved to the BIG Banks!!

I am going to exercise my option to buy, which is $21,400.  The car is in excellent condition, I have only put 16,000 miles on it.  Comparable 2006 Infiniti G35s at a dealership cost $24,000 - $26,500.    I plan to pay the Connecticut car taxes and fees in cash, put down approximately $4,000 of the price, and would like to finance the remainder.  I could put down substantially more in cash if I desired, however, I am saving for an engagement ring for my girlfriend, and the subsequent wedding of course.  Thus, paying off the $17,500 over three years will allow for a relatively small car payment and free up ample cash to have the ring by Fall, and then save for the wedding in Summer of 2011.  Financially, I am in very sound shape.  I am an attorney, currently working as an international tax and global restructuring senior associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP.  The firm, unlike its Big 4 counterparts, has announced it intends to weather the financial crisis without laying off employees.  Irrespective of this, I work in an area of tax law that is doing robust business due to pending proposed legislation involving multinational corporations.    I have been with PwC for over three years, and have consistently received the highest possible ratings during our year end review process.  I currently make $117,500 a year before bonuses.  My monthly take-home income, after 401(k) contributions, is approximately $7,000.     My main monthly expense is the approximately $2,600 I pay in home ownership cost (inclusive of insurance, condo fee, and utilities).  Otherwise I pay $350 in monthly student loans, and then for the basics (cable, cell phone, car insurance, gas, etc).  I have zero credit card debt.  My current lease payment is $516 a month, so the montly payment on the loan I am seeking would be more than this, but not substantially more.  That pretty much covers it.  I have a very secure job that pays well, and the reason I am looking to finance the purchase is so I can save for a ring and wedding over the next two years, while still having ample cash on hand to live life.  Thank you for your time and your assistance.",car,2006 Infiniti G35 coupe lease buyout,069xx,CT,8.61,0,2,,,14,0,3524,8.7,28,f,1907.25,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,117th week,0,,,,1

I have paid down some of that debt since graduating but if I consolidated my debts I believe my credit score would improve and I would save money. I think my rates on my credit cards would also decline if I consolidated since my credit score would improve.<br/><br/>Credit Quality:<br/>- I have never paid a bill late<br/>- My credit score is low because of my limited credit history<br/>- Generally speaking, in a typical year by bonus is equal to my base salary. My bonus is paid in January each year. Last year I earned a little over $125,000 in base and bonus combined. This year my base has increased to over $100K <br/><br/>Expected Payoff:<br/>- I can easily meet the monthly payments on this 3 year loan. After paying all my loan interest payments, rent, and recurring bills each month I have about $2,500 of disposable income each month. <br/><br/>Savings:<br/>I have about $30K is my IRA which constitutes the majority of my net worth but that is not liquid. If I lost my job, which I believe is highly unlikely, I would be able to access some of that IRA without penalty to make sure I could pay my bills like the interest on this loan.<br/>  > Additional Details:<br/>I was not specific enough when I talked about how much debt I had coming out of college.  After my 1st year bonus I retired all of my student loans.  So in my first year I paid down about $10,000 of student loan debt.  Last bonus I paid down about $5,000 of credit card debt.  Today I have roughly $12,000 of remaining credit card debt with interest rates between 10% and 29%.  I also have a car loan for a certified pre-owned car I purchased last year for my commute to work.  On that loan my interest rate is 3.9% and my monthly payment is under $300 a month.<br/><br/>Please submit additional questions as they arise.  Happy to answer any questions to improve the lending decision for anyone interested here.<br/>  > Only $800 left.  Let's get this close today so i can start paying my great group of new lenders.<br/>  > It takes a village of 180 investors. now we just need number 181 to put up the last $25.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation,941xx,CA,10.43,0,1,,,11,0,10847,99.1,20,f,2561.17,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,104th week,0,,,,1

I work for a great environmental consulting firm and love my job. I also have an undying love of motorcycles, specifically sports bikes. I would like to tell you a little about myself before I get into the details of my business.  After all, a good idea is just that without someone to grow it into a profitable business. <br/><br/>I am what some would characterize, as an &ldquo;A-Type&rdquo; person.  When I set my mind on something, it always gets done.  Whether it is delivering projects on time and budget at work or promising to pick up a friend on the side of a road on my personal time, my word is good as titanium!  Therefore, I do not give my word lightly, unless I am sure I can deliver. From my core, I know this business will be profitable, even in this recession. I feel like this is perfect timing, while we are at the bottom of the recession and slowly climbing out.  I personally know this from the amount of jobs that are being designed and constructed in my firm. If you need to know more about the person behind the business, just ask.  I will try to respond right away, but sometimes this is not possible during my working day.  I will definitely answer your questions by the end of the workday.<br/><br/>I will be opening my motorcycle repair shop in the SOMA district in San Francisco, sometime in March 2011.  This will be my model shop, since I plan to expand to the rest of the Bay Area. I have about a fourth of the equipment for the shop, i.e., tire machine, hydraulic lift, and misc tools. I have very low overhead, since I will not be buying motorcycle apparel inventory.  Sometime in the future, I will be selling motorcycle apparel from a Japanese leather company that would like to start selling in the Bay Area, again.  I have a direct contact with one of the owners and I am brokering a deal that the shop will not incur upfront cost for the first six months.<br/><br/>I will be buying used motorcycles to recondition and sell. I already have two in my garage to sell. I plan to be an authorized repair facility with major insurance carriers, i.e., AAA, State Farm, Progressive, Geico Insurance, etc.  Motorcycle insurance jobs are usually several thousand dollars to repair on average and the shop will actively seek this type of repair jobs.<br/><br/>The business will be modeled similarly to a salon-type structure, whereas the mechanic will rent out a service station and will be able to use the shop equipment for a fee. The fee for renting out the service bay will be $1500.00 a month. All service technicians working for the shop will be able to handle any job, from a simple oil change to complete engine tear-down and rebuild. They will be paid a commission split of 60/40 (60% to the shop, 40% to mechanic). The shop labor rate will be between $88-$110 per hour, depending on the mechanic&rsquo;s level of experience. <br/><br/>With over 45 years of combined motorcycle service experience. I already have three journeyman mechanics onboard for my shop and they will be able to diagnosis and repair customer&rsquo;s vehicles quickly and correctly, the first time. By hiring journeyman mechanics, this will limit the number of incorrect diagnosis that plague shops that hire cheap, inexperienced mechanics with no former shop experience or that are fresh out of tech schools. After all, repeat business is how businesses survive the long haul.  I want to build an excellent reputation for the motorcycling community. <br/><br/>There are a lot of other great details, but I can only give a short description for now. Please contact me with any questions you may have.  Thank you ahead of time for your time and consideration.<br/>  > One more day left.  Thanks to all my investors...I will not let you down!<br/>",small_business,Motorcycle Repair Shop,941xx,CA,21.22,0,0,,,23,0,16296,43.7,35,f,2808.75,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,139th week,0,,,,1
